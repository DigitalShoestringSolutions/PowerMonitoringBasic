#    Power Monitoring (Basic solution) -- This digital solution measures,
#    reports and records both AC power and current consumed by an electrical 
#    equipment, so that its energy consumption can be understood and 
#    taken action upon. This version comes with one current transformer 
#    clamp of 20A that is buckled up to the electric line the equipment 
#    is connected to. The solution provides a Grafana dashboard that 
#    displays current and power consumption, and an InfluxDB database 
#    to store timestamp, current and power.
